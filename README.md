# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Challenge 3 of edX Boot Camp (Front End) to create my portfolio website using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

## Description

For Weekly Challenge 3 of the edX Bootcamp Front End Course, I was given 
a task of building  portfolio website using the Bootstrap CSS Framework showcasing my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 

I have provided below details of the User Story, Acceptance Criteria, Resources and Assessment Requirements.



> What was my motivation?

My motivation was to accelerate my front end skills in web development so I can successsfully secure a web development job. 


>Why I built this project?

Building the website helped me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical of Bootstrap 5
and applying also what I learnt in Weeks 1 to 3.


> What problem did it solve?

It helps me to build on my website design skills and provides a portfolio of my work
that can be shown to employers seeking web developers. Using Bootstrap 5, made my development task easier.


> What did I learn?

I learnt the skills in building a website from scratch from the edX course and plus researching the web. I learnt about Bootstrap 5, Grid system, researching material on the web and designing/writing quality websites. I learnt that using Bootstrap 5, makes 
websites more responsive with a modern look and feel and also saving the developer time ! 


> What makes my project stand out? 

The project work that I have completed stands out as it follows all the design principles of a good website using industry standards. 
It uses Bootstrap 5, the modern front end framework. I have implemented hover effects when I hover over images and buttons that have a hyperlink.
The Contact Me section has lovely icons and hovering over the links, displays a box shadow.

   - Create a folder structure.

     - Create a `index.html`.

     - Create a `css` folder.

       - Inside create a `style.css` file.

   - Create an `images` folder.

       - Place all your images in this folder.

4. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   The website should include the following bootstrap components:

    - A Navigation bar
    
    - A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.

      - Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
  
        - Links should navigate to the appropriate sections 

    - A hero section

        - A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

    - A work section

        - If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/ 

      - Use bootstrap cards for each project.

        - The description should give a brief overview of the work.

      - Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

    - A skills section

      - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section.

      - An "About Me" section in the same row.

      - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

5. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

## Instructions - Commits

* Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

* Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

  * We use the mantra “commit early and often.”  This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!

  * Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.

* Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

  * When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.

* We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
